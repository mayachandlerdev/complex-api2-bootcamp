# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 2

### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned

Welcome to my complex gif API! 

For this API, all you need to do is search a name or place, get back country codes related to that search and then recieve a gif related to your search! :)
